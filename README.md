# Employee Attrition Analysis using Tableau

This project aimed to develop an interactive visualization dashboard using Tableau to analyze employee attrition data within IBM. By leveraging data visualization techniques, the project sought to uncover insights and patterns related to employee attrition, enabling informed decision-making and strategies to improve employee retention.

## Project Overview

- **Dataset**: IBM employee attrition dataset from Kaggle, containing various features such as age, business travel frequency, daily rate, department, distance from home, education level, gender, job satisfaction, marital status, and the target variable (attrition: yes or no).
- **Key Objectives**:
  - Develop an interactive visualization dashboard to explore employee attrition patterns.
  - Identify factors influencing employee attrition and their interrelationships.
  - Provide insights to support decision-making processes related to employee retention strategies.

## Dashboard Story

I have preprocessed the data, applied association rule mining to determine which factors contribute to the attrition most individualy and combined as well. Then focusing on those few perticular attributes i have develoepd my dashboard stories in detail. The visualization dashboard comprises four main components:

1. **Demographics Dashboard**: Explores the interconnections between age, marital status, number of companies worked, job satisfaction, and their impact on employee attrition, enabling the identification of demographic-specific trends.

2. **Age Dashboard**: Focuses on workforce demographics, facilitating informed decision-making in areas such as succession planning, training initiatives, and fostering an inclusive workplace that caters to various age groups.

3. **Salary Dashboard**: Provides insights into compensation structures, empowering informed decisions to attract and retain top talent, ensuring a prosperous and equitable journey for all employees.

4. **Ratings Dashboard**: Analyzes attrition based on the work environment, deciphering the impact of workplace conditions on employee retention, and helping organizations enhance their work environment to foster employee satisfaction, engagement, and reduce attrition rates.
